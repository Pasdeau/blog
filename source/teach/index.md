During my PhD, I have been teaching laboratory (TP) and tutorial (TD) sessions at Polytech Sorbonne—the engineering school of Sorbonne Université—as well as in the **Licence** EEA track (Électronique, Énergie Électrique, Automatique) and the **Master** SESI track (Systèmes Électroniques et Systèmes Informatiques).

# Simulation of Electronic Circuits

For second-year undergraduate students, conduct simulation experiments in PSpice to implement the fundamental workflow of modeling→simulation→result verification, making the key metrics of common linear networks, operational amplifiers, and CMOS logic quantifiable, interpretable, and reproducible. The experiments cover linear networks, operational amplifiers, and CMOS logic. Netlists are written, and `.OP/.DC/.AC/.TRAN` analyses are configured to complete bias-point, Bode, and transient verification. Capture CIS/Probe is used to establish standard modeling and plotting workflows. Design cases include Thevenin equivalent circuits, −3 dB determination for cascaded RC networks, and parameter scans for peak detection, with FFT-based spectrum and tolerance evaluation. Extensions cover LF411 GBW/slew-rate measurements and CMOS inverter ringing-frequency assessment.

# Analog Electronics

For third-year undergraduate students, using LTspice and breadboards, establish a closed-loop process of design→implementation→verification, producing reusable prototypes and documentation. During experiments, build foundational models for diodes, BJTs/MOSFETs, and operational amplifiers to perform DC/AC/transient simulations. Use these models to design prototypes for bias circuits, common-emitter/common-source amplifiers, differential amplifiers, and op-amp applications (inverting/non-inverting, active filtering, rectification/voltage regulation). Develop a physical-measurement workflow using oscilloscopes, function generators, and multimeters to evaluate bandwidth, distortion, and phase margin. Document reproducible results to ensure consistency between simulation and physical measurements.

# Microcontroller

For third-year undergraduate students, using the STM32F103 series microcontroller, complete bare-metal development from scratch and implement interrupt/timer coordination on the Keil µVision5 platform to achieve measurable and reproducible timing and peripheral control. The experiment involves setting up the project and debugging environment, initializing GPIO and the system clock via register access, and verifying functionality on the board. Design time- and event-management based on SysTick/EXTI, standardize interrupt-priority and response testing, implement dual-timer coordination and PWM to generate 40 kHz ultrasonic pulse trains, and evaluate jitter and resource utilization. Example code and documentation are organized to form a reusable experimental framework.
